# In order to reduce lock contention and thus improve performance,
# each incoming connection request picks off a connection from a
# pool that has thread-affinity.
# The higher this number, the better your performance will be for the
# case when you have plenty of short-lived threads.
# Beyond a certain threshold, maintenance of these pools will start
# to have a negative effect on performance (and only for the case
# when connections on a partition start running out).
db.default.partitionCount=4

# The number of connections to create per partition. Setting this to
# 5 with 3 partitions means you will have 15 unique connections to the
# database. Note that BoneCP will not create all these connections in
# one go but rather start off with minConnectionsPerPartition and
# gradually increase connections as required.
db.default.maxConnectionsPerPartition=30

# The number of initial connections, per partition.
db.default.minConnectionsPerPartition=2

# When the available connections are about to run out, BoneCP will
# dynamically create new ones in batches. This property controls
# how many new connections to create in one go (up to a maximum of
# maxConnectionsPerPartition). Note: This is a per-partition setting.
db.default.acquireIncrement=2

# After attempting to acquire a connection and failing, try to
# connect this number of times before giving up.

# The maximum time to wait before a call
# to getConnection is timed out.

# This sets the time for a connection to remain idle before sending a test query to the DB.
# This is useful to prevent a DB from timing out connections on its end.
