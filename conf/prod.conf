# In order to reduce lock contention and thus improve performance,
# each incoming connection request picks off a connection from a
# pool that has thread-affinity.
# The higher this number, the better your performance will be for the
# case when you have plenty of short-lived threads.
# Beyond a certain threshold, maintenance of these pools will start
# to have a negative effect on performance (and only for the case
# when connections on a partition start running out).

# The number of connections to create per partition. Setting this to
# 5 with 3 partitions means you will have 15 unique connections to the

# gradually increase connections as required.

# When the available connections are about to run out, BoneCP will
